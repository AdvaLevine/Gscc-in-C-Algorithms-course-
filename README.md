Finding the Gscc for a simple directional graph using c++ 
During algorithms course we've focused on graphs algorithms, spasifically we've learned an algorithm to create the gscc using Kosaraju's algorithm
On this project I've implemented the algorithm we've learned and created the gscc (strongly connected components graph).
